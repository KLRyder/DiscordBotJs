"# DiscordBotJs" 

This repo is here for posterity reasons. The code contained within is very poorly structured, and an entire re-creation of this project is underway.

A quick and dirty discord chatbot built to handle some of my discord servers joke requests. Lots of hardcodeing, but a nice way of getting back into JS.

NB:
The use of the .blur command requires a bit of setup. you must create a folder called workingImages in the directory that the bot is run from that contains a .exe called RadilBlurCommandline.exe that takes in a file and preforms a radial blur on it. A slightly edited version of RadialBlur.cs found here: https://github.com/KLRyder/WpfRadialBlur/tree/master/WpfApplication1 will do fine. A fix to make this all happen automatically is incoming.

Need to fix up some of the code to make it more reusable and am looking into sorting out more commands.
